# web-dev portfolio

## My Task

As a junior developer, I was tasked with creating a deployed portfolio of work samples to be utilized for future job applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
WHEN the portfolio is loaded the user should be presented with my name
THEN a photo/avatar (I disagree-personal choice), and links to sections about me, my work and how to contact me.
WHEN the user clicks one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to corresponding section.
WHEN the user clicks one of the links to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to the section with titled images of my applications.
WHEN the user is presented with my first application
THEN that application's image is larger in size than the others.
WHEN the user clicks on the images of the applications
THEN they are taken to that deployed application.
WHEN the user resizes the page or views the site on various screens and devices
THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport
